# NumWorks
A bunch of Python script for the NumWorks calculator

The file ```draw.py``` is necessary for the other scripts to work, it's a script full of functions completing Kandinsky module's purposes.

I am currently working on the chess game, which is working (but draw and mate, even if checks are recognised) but can be improved.

Note :
These scripts are made for the NumWorks calculators, and only works for it, because they use Kandinsky and Ion modules.
